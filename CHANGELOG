openDCIM is an Open Source Software alternative for Data Center Infrastructure Management.

This is a list of changes made from version to version.  This is not intended to be a
comprehensive bug tracking list.  Issues (bugs, enhancements, etc) are tracked on
GitHub, at http://github.com/samilliken/openDCIM/issues, where you can also download
the latest development version.  However, it is not advised to pull from GitHub unless you
are simply testing, as some functionality can break between releases.
