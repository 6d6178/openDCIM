== Upgrading from a Previous Version ==

If you have already installed a previous version of openDCIM, you should be able to simply unzip and
untar the distribution directly over the existing.  However, there could be some bugs that were not
caught by the developers, so it is recommended that you extract the archive to a new directory and test
it there against your dataset.  It is also possible that some files are removed or consolidated
between versions, so if you want to keep the directly clean of any unused files, follow the
instructions below for a safe migration setup.

=== Setting up a Safe Migration Test ===

1.  Make a copy of your database - if your production DB is called openDCIM, then dump it to a file,
create a new database called test_openDCIM, and import the database into it.  Here's an example:

$ mysqldump --opt openDCIM > dbdump.sql
$ echo "create database dev_openDCIM" | sudo mysql -u root -p
$ echo "grant all on dev_openDCIM.* to '%'@'localhost'" | sudo mysql -u root -p
$ mysql dev_openDCIM < dbdump.sql

You'll need to adjust your grant statement to match your site specifics, but this should give you an
idea of what's needed.

2.  Extract your archive to a folder (or different server) than what is already running, and
configure your web server to serve that directory.  Remember that you will still need to set up
user authentication, so you will probably want to use SSL.

3.  Configure your db.inc.php file in the test root directory (Use db.inc.php-dist as a template).  
Copy any data center drawings from the production drawings/ folder to the test drawings/ folder.  
Copy any custom logo that you may have set up to the images/ folder of the test folder.

4.  Look for any migration SQL files included in the archive!  For instance, there is a file called
db-1.0-to-1.1.sql file that will make changes from a version 1.0 install to a version 1.1 install.
The migration files are not cumulative, so if you are migrating more than one version, it is possible
that you will have to apply multiple files.  The migration files are commented, so check to see if
the changes will appear to break any functionality that you are currently using.  To apply the files
you would simply execute them like you executed the create.sql file:

$ mysql dev_openDCIM < db-1.0-to-1.1.sql

5.  Pull up the test site in your browser and check to see if everything looks ok.


== The Cowboy Way ==

Just drop the archive onto the existing install and hope for the best.
